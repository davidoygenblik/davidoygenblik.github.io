Hello! My name is David Oygenblik and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Professor Brendan Saltaformaggio in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia
Institute of Technology. My research interests span program analysis, memory forensics, program instrumentation and machine learning.

On a day to day you'll catch me hiking, weight-lifting, doing escape rooms, playing with my cat, or just enjoying the city of Atlanta. Also a bit of a coffee addict... :(
